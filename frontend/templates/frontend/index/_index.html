							Sports nutrition is oriented to establish the dietary guidelines that along with the
							training routine optimize the results that are desired depending on the sport being
							performed.

							The role of nutrition in this area is of the utmost importance, since food represents one of
							the three factors that influence the practice of the exercise that is carried out.
						{% endblocktrans %}
					</p>
					<p>
						{% blocktrans %}
							Nutritional treatments in addition to taking into account the individual characteristics:
							age, sex, body composition will also include the sports routine to be performed optimizing
							the performance of physical training: improve work efficiency and decrease fatigue during
							exercise.
						{% endblocktrans %}
					</p>
					<p>
						{% blocktrans %}
							The nutrients will be used in favor of their characteristics to generate the maximum
							benefits in the individual according to his physical training. For example, if you are
							looking for muscle hypertrophy exercises, the treatment will be oriented to provide foods,
							(in this case protein) that give the highest content of essential amino acids that generate
							this effect. If it is a resistance exercise (cycling, marathon, triathlon), nutrition will
							be planned to supply energy-fuel foods (in this case carbohydrates) so that a more efficient
							aerobic work can be achieved by delaying fatigue and therefore recovery period.
						{% endblocktrans %}
					</p>
					<p>
						{% blocktrans %}
							For athletes or those planning a gradual increase in levels of physical activity, it is
							essential to adapt the food and thus meet the most demanding needs of the body. Nutrition is
							essential because it provides the quantity and quality of energy to develop the exercise,
							feeding generates impact on the strength, performance and recovery of any sport activity.
						{% endblocktrans %}
					</p>
					<p>
						{% blocktrans %}
							It is important to emphasize that sports nutrition includes the basic criteria of balanced
							human feeding during the day, and this is planned to cope with training loads and favor
							recovery. Through sports nutrition the athlete is advised, guided and educated to know what,
							when and why they should eat certain foods.

							The sports nutritionist is the figure that establishes the proper diet plan for a
							professional or amateur athlete and his / her particular characteristics, taking into
							account both the factors of age, sex and body composition, as well as the type of training
							(aerobic or anaerobic) and its duration.
						{% endblocktrans %}
					</p>
					<p>
						{% blocktrans %}
							Its most important task is to ensure adequate intake of patient calories, macro and micro
							nutrients to maximize sports performance, providing the necessary tools to achieve the
							objectives initially set as goals. These goals are always unique for each athlete in
							particular (increase muscle mass, decrease fat mass, increase endurance, decrease periods of
							fatigue, etc.) for this reason each treatment or nutritional plan must be individualized.
						{% endblocktrans %}
					</p>
					<p>
						{% blocktrans %}
							The sports nutritionist should also know the eating habits, lifestyle, as well as all the
							details of the training routine so that you can customize a specific meal plan to the
							particular
							needs of each one.
						{% endblocktrans %}
					</p>
					<p>
						{% blocktrans %}
							The purpose is to nutritionally educate the athlete so that he knows the importance of the
							quantity and quality of their food and apply this knowledge as a way of life.
